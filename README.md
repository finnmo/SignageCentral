# Signage Central

This is a front-end [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project to manage digital signage content

## Whats inside?

I try to keep this project as simple as possible, the front-end is made to be serverless, uploading and managing content through NextJS, stored connection with prismaDB and API through TRPC.

If you are not familiar with the different technologies used in this project, please refer to the respective docs. If you still are in the wind, please join our [Discord](https://t3.gg/discord) and ask for help.
